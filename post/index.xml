      <description>When I first started working with unreal engine, it was apparent that creating a door was clearly a right of passage. But there are many ways of making a door in unreal, and I noticed that most of the tutorials I had seen used the Tick function. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, using the tick function to create a door, especially in a super-beginner tutorial, is a great way of getting something working quickly.</description>
